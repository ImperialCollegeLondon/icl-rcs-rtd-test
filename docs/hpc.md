# High Performance Computing

The Research Computing Service (RCS) at Imperial College provide access to a large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilityâ€¯for non-interactive, high-throughput and highly parallel compute- and data-intensive tasks. 

You must be registered with the HPC service in order to use it. Please visit the Research Computing Service home page for information on how to register to use the HPC service. You will also need some experience with using the Linux Operating system and shell scripting before you use the HPC service; please see Using Linux for advice on where you can gain experience, including details on an appropriate course provided by the Graduate School at Imperial College.

These following pages will help you get started on this HPC facility. From these pages you can learn:

* What is High Performance Computing? (from the main RCS website)
* What HPC clusters are provided by the RCS (HPC Clusters Specification)
* How to connect to the service (Using SSH)
* Where you can store your data (Data Management on HPC)
* How to access software/applications installed on the HPC service (Accessing Software)
* Understand how to write a job script and submit it to the queue (Running your first job)
* Please see the Support and Training page for how to get help in using the HPC facility including details on an Introduction to HPC at Imperial College provided by the Graduate School.
